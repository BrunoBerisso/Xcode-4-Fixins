#+SEQ_TODO:TODO | DONE NOTDOING

* TODO column selection support

Should be possible to figure out something reasonable if number of
output lines exceeds number of input lines...

* DONE reinstate selection
  CLOSED: [2012-04-08 Sun 01:26]

(Optionally) reselect entire script output. Sensible defaults might
save on PBXSelection junk.

e.g., for my toupper script...

* DONE multiple tabs viewing same doc
  CLOSED: [2012-04-01 Sun 01:01]

Need to figure out which documentEditor has the focus...

* DONE multiple windows viewing same doc
  CLOSED: [2012-04-01 Sun 01:01]

Is this any different from the tabs case?

* DONE plist with key equivalents, etc.
  CLOSED: [2012-03-31 Sat 18:25]

* TODO Xcode3-style PBXFilePath (etc.)

Seems like a very flaky approach. Would need to create copy of script
with expansions in it. Would prevent use of binaries. Environment
variables would be much safer and hardly less easy to use...

* TODO inject junk into env?

* DONE check script symlinks work
  CLOSED: [2012-03-31 Sat 18:22]

* NOTDOING replace -[NSTextView insertText:replacementRange:] with some NSTextStorage thingy or other
  CLOSED: [2012-04-08 Sun 01:47]

[resolved: looks like a bad idea, as the NSTextStorage methods don't
seem to affect the undo queue!]

Will this still work with the autocomplete stuff?

Perhaps make it optional (some macros might still want to prompt an
autocomplete popup).

-[NSTextView insertText:replacementRange:] docs:

"This method is the entry point for inserting text typed by the user
and is generally not suitable for other purposes. Programmatic
modification of the text is best done by operating on the text storage
directly. Because this method pertains to the actions of the user, the
text view must be editable for the insertion to work."

* TODO scripts.xml name matching should be case-insensitive

...to match the filing system behaviour.

* DONE what if you have %%%{PBXSelection}%%% in the text?
  CLOSED: [2012-04-08 Sun 01:47]

[resolved: you live with it, or change the reselect mode]

well, currently it disappears if you run a macro on it...

What did Xcode3 do?
